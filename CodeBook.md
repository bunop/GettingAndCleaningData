============

The data present in the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

By sourcing `run_analysis.R` inside R evironment, data are downloaded from [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#) dataset in a `.zip` file in a temporary directory. Then files are unpacked and *train* and *test* dataset are reconstructed by loading the `X_train.txt` and `X_test.txt` file; Columns were labeled with `features.txt` file for each of the dataset. Activities are merged to *train* and *test* set dataset by adding `y_train.txt` and `y_test.txt` as a new column. Subject are added in the same way by adding `subject_train.txt`  and `subject_test.txt` as a new column on *train* and *test* dataset respectiveley. Then `activity_labels.txt` was used to replace the *activity id* with its appropriate label. Then *train* and *test* dataset were merged by rows and only the measurements which column name contain *mean* or *std* where extracted. Finally a *tidy dataset* was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This *tidy dataset* was dumped in the `tidy_dataset.txt` file.
